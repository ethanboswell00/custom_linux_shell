# custom_linux_shell

This is a simple Linux shell clone written in ANSI C. Runs most commands but does not support aliases (for example, 'ls -la' will not work as 'll').

To run, enter 'make', and then run './shell' to start the shell. Starts in the directory you start in but supports changing dir with the standard 'cd' command.
